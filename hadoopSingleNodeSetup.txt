Beshoi password hduser: hadoop
Robbie password hduser: Rockydog1!
//do this before going to the ssh
sudo apt-get install ssh

sudo service ssh start
//then you may continue with the ssh directions

//when installing hadoop
sudo tar xzf hadoop-2.5.1.tar.gz //instead of his directions because we have a latter version
sudo mv hadoop-2.5.1 hadoop //instead of his directions because we have a latter version

//after you already installed hadoop on your computer and have went to $HOME/.bashrc makes sure to reboot the computer to ensure no corruption

//note when editing hadoop-env.sh their directions are outdated so follow the ones i provide below

sudo gedit /usr/local/hadoop/etc/hadoop/hadoop-env.sh
//you will find something similar to the lines I provide below simply make it look like the line of code i provide

#modify JAVA_HOME
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk/

// you may continue following the sites directions

//ok so once again their file structure is outdated so ignore editing conf/core-site.xml (because it doesn't exist) and instead do the line i provide below

sudo gedit /usr/local/hadoop/etc/hadoop/core-site.xml //and then do the modifications that he asks of you from that file

//also ignore mapred-site.xml and edit mapred.site.xml.template which is in the same directory as the one above this
